# PokemonDetails: A Cross-Platform Pokédex App

PokemonDetails is a modern Pokédex application built with Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile (KMM), providing a seamless experience for exploring and discovering information about Pokémon across Android and iOS devices. 

## Features

* **Pokémon Listing:** Browse a comprehensive list of Pokémon, complete with sprites and basic information.
* **Detailed Information:** View detailed information about each Pokémon, including stats, abilities, types, evolution chain, and more.
* **Visually Appealing UI:**  Modern and intuitive user interface designed with platform-specific UI elements (Jetpack Compose for Android, SwiftUI for iOS).

## Technologies Used

* **Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile (KMM):** Shared business logic, data layer, and networking for Android and iOS.
* **Android:**
    * **Jetpack Compose:** Modern declarative UI toolkit for building native Android interfaces.
    * **ViewModel:** Architecture component for managing UI-related data and handling user interactions.
    * **Coil:** Image loading library for efficiently displaying Pokémon sprites.
      
* **iOS:**
    * **SwiftUI:** Declarative UI framework for building native iOS interfaces.
    * **Swift Concurrency (Async await):** The modern way to handle networking calls and actor annotation

* **Shared (KMM):**
    * **Kotlin Coroutines:** Asynchronous programming for managing background tasks and network operations.
    * **Kotlin Serialization:** Library for serializing and deserializing JSON data.
    * **Ktor:** Multiplatform HTTP client for making API requests.
* **Backend:**
    * **PokéAPI:** Public API used to retrieve Pokémon data.

## Architecture

The app follows the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architectural pattern on both platforms, ensuring a clear separation of concerns and testability.

* **Model:** Represents the Pokémon data and business logic of the application. Implemented using KMM for shared code.
* **View:** Displays the UI and handles user interactions. Implemented using Jetpack Compose for Android and SwiftUI for iOS.
* **ViewModel:** Acts as an intermediary between the View and the Model, preparing data for display and handling user actions.

## Benefits of KMM

* **Reduced development time and cost:** Shared codebase minimizes redundant work across platforms.
* **Improved code quality:** Single source of truth for business logic reduces inconsistencies and bugs.
* **Native performance:** UI is built using native frameworks (SwiftUI and Jetpack Compose) for optimal performance.
* **Easy maintenance:** Updates and bug fixes can be applied to both platforms simultaneously.

## Possible Enhancements

* **Type Effectiveness Chart:** Interactive chart to visualize type matchups.
* **Team Builder:** Allow users to create and manage Pokémon teams.
* **Search Functionality:** Easily find Pokémon by name or number.
* **Offline Capabilities:** Cache data for offline access, allowing users to browse Pokémon even without an internet connection.
* **Augmented Reality (AR):**  Integrate AR features to view Pokémon in the real world.

## Getting Started

* Clone the repository: `git clone [repository URL]`
* Open the project in Android Studio or Xcode.
* Build and run the app on your desired platform.
